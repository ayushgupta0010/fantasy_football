Principles of Data Science Final Project

Entering college, Ayush and I were never especially interested in football. That changed over the course of the semesters. Watching the Superbowl with friends opened our eyes to the excitement that the game brings, and with the Eagles winning this year, our love for the sport was cemented. A core part of football is fantasy football, where competitors can choose players from the entire league to be on their ‘fantasy’ team, which is judged by the individual statistics from each player throughout the season. With the key being to choose the best players, we thought it would be a rewarding and interesting challenge to try to predict what the best players would be in a fantasy football team.
After discussing, we developed a clear goal: to create an accurate and accessible way to predict the aptitude of a planned fantasy football team. Those two principles – accuracy and accessibility – were not chosen lightly, and the bulk of our time spent on the project was dedicated to optimizing them.
Our contributions were creating our own database with every player from 1970-2024 with their most important statistics, crafting 5 optimized models to analyze the data (and the models themselves) properly, and finally developing a website so people can create their own teams and see the differences between our models.
